      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey! I'm a 16-year-old frontend enthusiast. For the past year, I’ve been working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build clean and responsive websites.  
        I like simple design, and I always try to keep my code neat.  
        I mostly use VS Code and sometimes AI tools like ChatGPT to help with ideas and speed.  
        Right now, I'm just learning and building my portfolio — step by step.
